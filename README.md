# Penning Trap Project

It's a project for MIPT Computer Science classes.  

This project will be a numeric model of Penning trap with one particle in space (in future - more than one) and external EM fields.

The goal of this project is to perform our skills in Object-Oriented Programming and create sandbox with electromagnetic interactions between at least point particles in external field.
